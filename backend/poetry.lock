# This file is automatically generated by Poetry and should be committed to VCS.
# Poetry will use this file to resolve dependencies.
# This is a placeholder - run `poetry install` to generate the actual lock file.

# Note: The actual poetry.lock file will be generated when you run:
# docker-compose build backend
# or
# cd backend && poetry install
